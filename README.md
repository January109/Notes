# Notes
This is a collection of notes I've made which I figure might be useful for anyone interested. 

This repo currently contains various summaries from courses I've taken in the past. I'm planning on writing some notes on topics I'm yet to learn, and maybe some others on perspectives on various topics. (But at this point there probably won't be anything that interesting in the near future..)
